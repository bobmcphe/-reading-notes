# Node.js

## What is Node, Node.js, and NPM?

Node is short hand for Node.js, which is an asynchronous Javascript run-time engine. It is built on Google Chrome's 'V8 engine.' However, this should not be understood to mean that node runs in the browser, or that the node apps run in browser. It simply means, as James Hibbard writes, "the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating systemâ€“related utility methods."

Npm means 'Node Package Manager,' and creates a remarkable degree of functionality that Node otherwise would not have. Besides being a Javascript package manager, npm also is a software registry, the largest in the world. Lots of different software can be installed through npm, (e.g. by Hibbard is the jshint linter).

Node packages can be installed via npm locally or globally as needed. 

## What do I do with Node and NPM?

Perhaps the most important feature of Node.js is its ability to let us run JavaScript on a server. Though this is neither new, nor something that Node alone allows for--it does it best. In short, Node is a superior product that "provides some unique benefits, compared to tradtional languages," as Hibbard explains. 

For example, it it is much faster since the I/O operations are not blocked by each subsequent thread. Although Node is single-threaded, it is also event-driven. That is, while it is waiting for a thread to complete it's task, it can still execute a callback, instead of waiting on the first thread to finish. 

Node is ideal for sites that require instant and real-time interaction or communication (e.g. chat rooms). Node can also be used as a scripting language, and it should be noted that it uses the "most important data exchange format on the Web" that is, JSON.
