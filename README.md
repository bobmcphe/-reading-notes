1. Day 1

Ch 1. Structure - HTML is the markup language that structures a website, primarily by using tags and elements. This is comparable to the way a newspaper or MS Word documents are structured, and breaks down essentially into three main sections, the header, the body, and the footer. The best way to think of HTML is that it uses tags to create containers, with different containers being for different purposes. 

Ch. 8. Extra Markup - This chapter covers various idiosyncratic and variegated subjects that are hard to categorize into a single subject. Comments are necessary for HTML and look like this <!-- Comment -->

Id and class attributes, used for styling, are crucial, ID using the # symbol and class using the . symbol.

Common and helpful HTML tags are the `<div>` and `<span>`. These help group sections of a site that might not otherwise be grouped into a section. The `<meta>` tag is primarily used to communicate information to the computer about the page itself, and when we want to show HTML characters, that is, characters reserved for coding, we have to escape them by using special sets of codes, else they will be read as HTML instead of 'normal' English.

Ch. 17. HTML5 Layout - HTML5 operates differently (and is still being modified) from previous versions. One of the big changes is the use of specific codes, such as `<main>` instead of using `<div>` tags all the time. However, older browsers are not necessarily able to use HTML5 seamlessly, and so we need to use extra Javascript for this. 

Ch. 18. Process & Design - Designing a website well is largely determined by understanding the target audience. For example, a medical website might be targeted at patients, hospitals, or even medical practictioners; each are enormously different. Since 'design is about communication' as Duckett says, understanding our audience is key to communicating to them. The so-called 'visual hierarchy' helps in understanding this. That is, the first part of the site, above the fold is usually big, colorful, and easy to understand--this is what is seen first. The lower one travels down a page, the less important the content should be. In short, this is like the beginning of a good article or sales pitch...the first few seconds matter the most. Further, how objects are grouped determined how they are understood, which should not be overlooked.

Ch. 1. JS Intro - The book explains computers as making a model of the world that we know, and these models interact with other aspects through events, objects, methods, and properties. Objects have properties, events can trigger methods which can do things like create or modify objects and properties. Normally, we try to keep Javascrip in its own file, separate from the HTML file and the CSS file, using the `<script>` tag to either add a small amount of custom code, or call the file that loads the code for us.
