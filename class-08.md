## Ch. 15 - Layout

There are various ways of controlling and structuring the layout of a website. One particular way of doing this is the float property, which can move the site's content either left or right as far as possible. This can allow for the creation of multi-column layouts--but it is important to know that any floated element must have a defined width. Pages themselves can have widths that can be either fixed or 'liquid', (which uses percentage instead of pixels). This liquid, more responsive layout, does have some disadvantages. For example, the site can easily 'look very different than you intended.' The advantages and disadvantages of each should be considered before building a page. 

 Despite the fact that screen sizes have become far more variable today, typically, web developers usually keep sites within 960-1000 px wide, which are then broken down into grids to make the site more professional and scalable. In fact, the 960.GS grid is one of the most communly used framework. Frameworks make web development much easier and quicker, however, this is because they have a lot of prewritten code, like a template, if you will, which you can use. But this can have the unintended consequence of make a site much more bulkier than is desirable. The 960.GS website, for example, offers several 12 column grids you can use, to the preference of the designer. These grids, in short, use the standard rules of aesthetics; proportion, harmony, and so on. The benefits the book lists on page 387:

1. "Creates a continuity between different pages which may use different designs"
1. "Helps users predict wehre to find information on various pages"
1. "Makes it easier to add new content to the site in a consistent way"
1. "Helps people collaborate on the disng of a site in a consistent way"

As an interesting aside, the phrase "above the fold" is actually a cross-over term from the newspaper industry, where the top front cover of a newspaper, after it was folded in half, is immediately visible to the reader.
