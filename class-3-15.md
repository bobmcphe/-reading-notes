## Diversity and Inclusion

T. L. Andrews, a freelance journalist, details (and admits that monocausal explanations are always incomplete), how the tech industry shift towards games, which has the natural effect of focusing on boys and men, decreased the number of women in the industry.

In fact, he mentions that that "only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female." He reports that these stats were different back in the 70s and 80s - the peak showing 37% of computer science graduates being female. 

However, the fact is, we need to stop right here. Carrie L. Lukas, Harvard graduate and president of the Independent Women's Forum, details the fact that an extremely large number of women who graduate never enter the work force when they realize that their ability to have a family or children will be diminished. In other words, significant numbers of women choose to never enter the profession they are trained for. Thus, Andrews comparison of women in the tech industry today and women graduating with tech degrees then, is an illegtimate comparison - creating an exagerated disparity. The solution would be to compare the *actual* number of women who were in the tech industry in the 70s and 80s. 

In fact, (as a philosopher, whose hat I am incapable of, and indeed duty-bound, to not take off), there are many problems with Andrews' assumptions - many of which we cannot detail here. 

He goes on to document the experience of Professor Linda Sax, a researcher at UCLA. She describes her younger self as confident in mathematic abilities, but she explains this changed. She shares a story about how her question was dismissed by a professor, yet the same question was asked by a male student, who did receive an answer. 

Andrews goes on - with another major blunder, in fact - saying that 45% of women are more likely to exit the tech industry. However, again to reference Carrie Lukas, this is overwhelmingly due to the desire to have and raise children, a factor that is not taken into account in these studies. If Andrews wishes to promote the truth of being inclusive, it is pertinent to be precise. This means accounting only, for example, the times when women leave the industry because it is a hostile environment. Countless studies that reveal a mass exodus of females from various industries have been shown to be wanting. Lukas gives the explanation:

In 2000, the polling firm, Public Agenda, conducted a survey of 815 parents of children under age five, as well
as focus groups and interviews with employers, children’s advocates, and those in the child care field and issued
a report called “Necessary Compromised.” The survey results from the parents revealed an even more striking
preference for parental care. When asked the questions, “Which would you say is the best child care
arrangement during a child’s earliest years: to have one parent stay at home; to have both parents work different
shifts so one is almost always at home; to have a nanny or babysitter at home; to have a close relative look after
the child; to bring the child to a mom in the neighborhood who cares for children in her home; or to place a child
in a quality day care center,” 70 percent of respondents thought it was best for one parent to be at home. Another
14 percent preferred both parents working different shifts. Just 6 percent thought a “quality day care center” was
the best arrangement for kids. In another question, parents overwhelmingly listed daycare as their “least
preferred option.” More than seven in ten parents of children under five agreed with the statement “parents
should only rely on a day care center when they have no other option.” 

Andrews assumes - most tragically of all, for it undermines valid and honorable kinds of inclusivity - that men and women, in general, have the same desires, goals, and aptitudes. However, psychologist Alice Eagly, who does not put much stock into the idea of biological differences, nevertheless concludes that scientists currently studying men and women “have begun to realize” that they have shattered “not cultural stereotypes,” but the “scientific consensus forged in the feminist movement of the 1970’s.”

Women have contributed mightily to the tech industry - a reality that requires all honest folks everywhere to give all honor where honor is due. In fact, any heallthy approach to the topic of being inclusive requires giving all honor where honor is due. That includes, however, science that shows the other explanatory facts besides advertisers focusing on boys to keep the gaming industry alive. The law of unintended consequences played a part in women being less involved in the tech industry but more in other industries, such as lawyers, doctors, etc. But what do we do if less women in tech is bad for that industry, but a net plus for others?

In fact, the law of unintended consequences is a constant difficulty in any political policy.

To continue, USA Today reports on the benefits of women in the work force: 'According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."'

The CEO of Intel agrees. 

The article continues, an '03 study suggests that banks that focus on being inclusive are banks that are also more financially successful. More interestingly, however, the article holds the view that, "Some of these leaders have noted that the tech industry is creating vast opportunity and that by excluding certain groups from that opportunity the industry is perpetuating and exacerbating existing social inequality."

However, it is a blatant Marxist assumption that society distributes wealth, and creates inequality - a fact refuted by the the most brilliant, and African-American, economist in the United States. For example, in Sowell's recent book, he explains that equal distribution is not natural, and is nowhere found in nature. Orlando to Tampa has about 90% of the United States lightening strikes, and the 'tornado alley' has about 90% of the tornadoes - when America alone has about 90% of worldwide tornadoes. Thus, he reasons, why should we assume that equal distribution (confirmed by concepts like the Pareto effect), are natural (a concept going back to Rousseau)?

The USA Today article ends by suggesting that we need to decide that diversity matters, which could be better articulated by saying that love matters. Love covers a multitude of wrongs, and does not hate, is not proud, and does not judge a person ungraciously, but assumes the best. Perhaps the best way to be inclusive is to focus less on lifeless (and overwhelmingly dishonest) numbers, but love. Focusin on love enables us to include all that is lovely, true, commendable, and of a good report.
