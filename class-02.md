#Summary of Reading

Ch. 2. - HTML elements essentially breakdown into two kinds of markup; semantic and structural. Structural markup would be like `<body>` or `<div>` while semantic would be tags like `<em>` for emphasis and `<cite>` for citing a reference. These details are helpful and professional, helping the browser--with a few exceptions--understand things like definitions, acronyms, and other texts that play a special role. This in turn, of course, helps the end user.

Ch. 10. - CSS - Per Duckett, "CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear." (p 277). CSS can be applied on a block level, or on an in-line level, basically macro and micro, respectively. All CSS declarations have a property, which in turn is given some kind of value, for example, the `<h1>` may be given the CSS property of `color`, with the value of `red`. Originarily, we link an external CSS file to do the majority of our CSS work. 

Ch. 2. - Basic JavaScript Instructions - This section essentially defines various JS features. Some of them include

Data types, such as strings eg; "Hi, I am a string!", numbers, (self-explanatory), and boolean datay types, which equate to true or false. 

Arrays, which start counting at zero, is essentially a list or group of values that related.

Expressions are of two types, one sort simply assigns a value to a variable, the other has two operands which create a single value. 

Comments follow the format // for short, single-line, and the /* */ for multi-line.

Ch. 10. - Decisions and Loops - Algorithms require something of a decision-making process, which requires evalutations, decisions, and oftentimes a degree of repitition. A flowchart best illustrates this. Various operators, such as the logical operators (&&, ||, !; and, or, and not respectively) to help with evalutating. Also If, (and else) as well as Switch statements are also for evalutating, ( and potentially looping). In short, it's best to use switch if there is a default position, and if/else if there is not one. Javascript uses type coercion, which means it is important to understand what is truthy and falsey. Many things are not strictly true or false in coding, but are treated this way, eg. a null, NaN, and 0 (not a string) are all treated as false, whereas '0' (written as a string), 'true' and "random words" are all treated as true. Lastly, For loops and While Loops are both useful and can (I think usually, but not always?) be translated into the other.
