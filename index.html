I was born in Texas but grew up in Kansas most of my life. I joined the Army at 
17 and eventually became a bomb technician. I deployed to Iraq, and then ETS'd so 
that I could get a degree in theology and philosophy, in Florida and England, respectively.

<p id= bio2>
    I have a house just north of Orlando which I am currently renting out, and I am happily married
    with 3 beautiful daughters, and another child on the way. I met my wife at church, about 6 years ago,
    and we will be celebrating our 6th anniversary, in fact, while we in England celebrating my graduation in March.
