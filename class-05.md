## Ch. 5 - Images

The `<img>` tag is used for images. As a rule of thumb, photos need to be jpg, and non-photos can be gifs or pngs, and these should all be stored in a folder. Although, if the sitemap gets complicated enough, it maybe helpful to break down the foldier directory into other sub-directories. Example would be the img foldier followed by the navigation folder and the blog images folder. Ideally, it is good for images to already be the size in which they will be used. 

## Ch. 11 - Color

Color is hierarchical, and so all colors are a combinations of red, green, and/or blue. These combinations create secondary colors which in turn create tertiary colors; all increasly derivative. The colors on the screen are created by a combination of these colors in a tiny square called a pixel. It is from this fact that we have what is, or used to be, called RGB monitors. Color picking tools allow us to specify the RGB value, although, we can also do this with the hex value. 

In addition, we also have the hue, saturation and brightness of a color. Saturation pertains to the idea of the degree of grey that is in the color, and the brightness value is determined by the amount of black that is in the color. Hue, on the other hand, seems harder to define. These are specified by HSL. Yet another value is opacity, the degree the color is capable of being seen through. This is easy to modify with the new CSS3 feature, RGBA or HSLA.

## Ch. 12 - Text

The two main kinds of font are those with little feet like things, and those with out, and 'sans' means without. Browser must have both of these categories, in fact, and a few others. Essentially, there are a small set of fonts that are universal, or near-universal. But more fonts can be loaded, but this can require extra work--and a license. 

Interestingly, the basic format for font size has not changed in about 4 or 500 years. European typesetters pioneered the present format, and to this day, the different sizes are standardized since they are naturally pleasingly to the eye. And althogh text size is measured in points(pt) instead of pixels (px), these loosely correspond, conveniently enough.
