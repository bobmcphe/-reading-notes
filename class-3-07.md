Polymorphic comes from polymorphism; it's etymology stems from biology, whereby "discontinuous genetic variation" intraspecies, such as some dogs have long hair and some having short hair, aka, micro-evolution (as opposed to macro), results in a widespread variagation of the species. 

This has little bearing, it seems, in the context of coding and software development. In this context, the example given is the ability of a verb to apply to many different nouns.

Some verbs do not apply to some nouns, (e.g. you do not say that you swam your hair or picked up the universe (yet, we just did, grammatically, is this not distinct from the logical inability to do so? Afterall, what about superheros and multiverses?)).

Thus, verbs  which can apply to nearly all objects are said to be 'polymorphic'. This is helpful for undertanding web development, since the Web Response Cycle requires interaction with (verbs) various objects in various locations (nouns). More technically, 'polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entitites of different types or the suse of a single symbol to represent multiiple different types." (wiki).

Thus, the semiotic ambiguity, interestingly, exists even in programming languages. 

## Google and Perfection

The New York Times article regarding the magic formula needed to create a cohesive team details what moral intuition has acknowledged for centuries - namely, cohesive teams are a sort of portable home, a place where a person can still find a state of psychological rest. Thus, there is no insecurity, need to validate, prove oneself, and so on. Put another way, each member has the sense of belonging on the team. 

For example, Sakaguchi was a project manager who had stage 4 cancer, a fact that helped the team gel better. Opening up and sharing one another's burdens humanizes the environment, creating community. Community is nothing but home more broadly understood. And only when we create a home can we have the rest we seek. This was further supported by Sakaguchi sharing with his teammates how their work helped fit in to the bigger picture at Google. Understanding our place is important to the human condition.

Unfortunately, the article did not make it clear how to know when this is true or not; that is, if our feelings line up with reality. After all, sometimes some people are not a good fit for a team, or a job, or a project. Perhaps somebody was a good fit, but after a tragic death, things have changed, etc.

Put another way, our feelings to create a good fit, but they can create a bad fit. Our feelings and perceptions should only reflect what is actually so. And some people are 'toxic', to use a buzz word, and are thus not a good fit. 

What is quite interesting, and worthy of note, is the following: 

‘‘I might be the luckiest individual on earth,’’ Sakaguchi told me. ‘‘I’m not really an engineer. I didn’t study computers in college. Everyone who works for me is much smarter than I am.’’ But he is talented at managing technical workers, and as a result, Sakaguchi has thrived at Google.

It is easy to think that in order to work for Google, you must be a tech nerd. However, this is not the case.
