## Chapter 9: pages 201-206 only
Flash is actually being phased out, but back in the 90s and until recently, it has been a common tool for displaying and/or creating music, videos and animations, even games. Files saved in an .fla format are used just for the creation environment, but the .swf files are what are used for the website. Interestingly, flash has even been used to create entire websites. But since around 2005, flash has slowly started to become passe. This is because, by way of example, Javascript features like JQuery and Prototype have made using Javascript easier for animation. Also, Apple shortly thereafter stopped supporting Flash. 

## Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)
Image dimensions should ordinarily be controlled by CSS, especially if many or all of the images on a site will be the same size. CSS also can controll the alignment. The default setting for images is as an inline element, thus the text flows around them on both sides. Often, we want to turn them into a block level element, however. 

Background images can be set to either repeat or appear once. There are a few different options, in fact. For example, you can repeat along the X-axis or the Y-axis, or both, or even set the image to scroll with the user. You can also create rollover effects. Lastly, if there are many images on a website, it is a good idea to reduce load time by creating image sprites. A sprite is "when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface..." For example, if there will be the same button image used on an e-commerce store, this would be great to make into a sprite.
